         Qno-8. What can be done using one type of loop can also be done using the other two types of loops - True or False

                In Java, any task done using one type of loop
(for, while, or do-while) can also be done using the other two loops.

The difference between them is only in syntax and when the condition is checked, not in capability.

🔁 Example: Print numbers 1 to 5
Using for loop
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

Using while loop
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

Using do-while loop
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
         */
    }
}
